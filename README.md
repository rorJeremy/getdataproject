# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This project repo and run_analysis script was made for a Getting and Cleaning Data course at Johns Hopkins University, distributed via coursera.org.

The run_analysis script does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Run the entire script by using the following command/function in the command line of R:
